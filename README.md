# Predicting-Tmperature-change
The application of machine learning (ML) to predict temperature changes from historical data analytics presents a significant advancement in climate science. Traditional climate models often rely on intricate physical equations, which can be computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-time changes (Abdelkefi, et al., 2024). In contrast, ML techniques have demonstrated superior performance in processing large datasets derived from satellite observations. These models can analyze multi-dimensional climate data—including temperature, air pressure, and CO2 concentrations—more efficiently than traditional methods. The implications for accurate climate prediction are profound, affecting not only natural ecosystems but also economic development and societal structures.
